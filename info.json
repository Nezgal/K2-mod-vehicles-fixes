  "description": "Some tweaks to mod vechicles grids and/or fuel when used with Krastorio 2:
  - Updates some mods vehicles' grid to only accept vehicle equipment
  - Adds grids to cargo ships & boats
  - Sets AAI industry fuel processing as prerequisite for hauler and chaingunner (they now only use vehicle fuel)
  - Nerfs AAI industry processed fuel to be worse than K2 standard fuel
  - Prevents solid fuel and rocket fuel from being used in machines and vehicles (now only accept K2 vehicle fuels + AAI prcessed fuel)
  - Adds chemical tech card as prerequisite for cargo ships automated bridges and deep sea oil extraction technologies

  AAI miner vehicles, locomotives and cargo ships can still use any fuel (not including solid and rocket)"
